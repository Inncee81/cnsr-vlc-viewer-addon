How to use cnsr files:
In order to make use of cnsr file you need to create a new file with the format as shown in 'example/example_file.cnsr'. We Have added some comments with explanation regarding the format inside the example file. 
The file name must be identical to the video name you want to play (except for the ending), and must be at the same directory as the video.

For example, if the video you want to play is:
c://User/Me/Desktop/myvid.mp4
Then the cnsr file should be:
c://User/Me/Desktop/myvid.cnsr
(currently there is an issue with directoris that have underscore or spaces, so try to avoid them)
